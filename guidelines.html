    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <h3>MusicBrainz ID</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">An unique identifier assigned to music releases by MusicBrainz. Make sure you input the correct release when searching!</p>
    <h3>Uploads</h3>
    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Mention the website, tracker or method through which you obtained the audio files. We expect you to be honest, as this helps users discern sources with lossy transcodes. It's okay to leave this empty if you don't know the source.</p>
    <h3>Uploads</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">All audio and image file types are allowed, plus .txt files for additional information regarding a release. Providing cue/log files for CD rips is appreciated, as it helps verify the quality of your upload. For vinyl rips, include the lineage (equipment used to rip the record). Your audio files will not be stored after being spectographed and verified (okay, FBI?).</p>
